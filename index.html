          <img src='./images/CrownMnt1.jpg' width="400" height="300" alt='I was climbing the crown mountain in Vancouvor'>
          <p><b>July 2017, in Vancouver, Canada</b><br>I went to climb the crown mountain without any preparation since I had no idea what hiking was, and I thought it should be easy. The climb ended up being quite tough. At the time of the photograph, we were hiking the steep rocks with only our bare hands and running shoes. During that time, I was so scared and I vowed I would never do this again.</p>  
        </div>
        <div class='storycontent'>
          <img src='./images/CrownMnt2.jpg' width="400" height="300" alt='View of Vancouver from the top of mountain'>
          <p>After the longest five hours of my life, we made it to the top with scratches and bruises. While I sat beside the rocks, I was able to see all of Vancouver. I felt on top of the city, but so small in the mountains. I sat there and felt the breeze, and that was the peace I'd never experienced before.</p>

          <p><b>September 2018, in Jiangxi, China</b><br>Unfortunately, my first time backpacking was in the pouring rain. Muddy, slippery trails, soaked clothing and a chill in the air. But when you have pals at your side, it won't be so bad.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='storycontent'>
          <img src='./images/WugongMnt2.jpg' width="400" height="300" alt='a vast sea of clouds'>
          <p>We could see the fog rolling over the mountain, creating a vast sea of clouds. In the pouring rain, we were all soaked but still cheering.</p>

        <div class="storycontent">
          <img src='./images/yubeng2.jpg' width="400" height="300" alt='snow mountains'>
          <p><b>June 2020, in Yunnan, China</b><br>I returned to China during covid after studying in the Umich for one year. 
            After my 2-week quarantine ended, I booked a flight to Yunnan immediately. 
            I needed to be in the wilderness, breathe in fresh air, and feel the sourness of my muscles when I hike to remind myself that I was still alive. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="storycontent">
          <img src='./images/yubeng3.jpg' width="400" height="300" alt='snow mountains'>
          <p>We hiked for three days through the village of Yubeng, which was hidden from the outside world for centuries at the foot of Meili snow mountain. While I had seen snow mountains before, I had a mixed feeling of excitement and fear when I was surrounded by them. While I wanted to run and scream freely in the wilderness, I did not dare to break the silence. </p>

        <div class="storycontent">
          <img src='./images/FourMnt4.jpg' width="400" height="300" alt='people climb down the snow mountain'>
          <p><b>May 2021, in Sichuan, China</b><br>After months of preparation, I finally decided to climb the snow mountain. At 14,764 feet (4500m), the air grew thin, breathing was more difficult, and each step was accompanied by thumping of my heart in my ear, and a pounding headache.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="storycontent">
          <img src='./images/FourMnt5.jpg' width="400" height="300" alt='reach the top of snow mountain'>
          <p>Step by step, I ascended slowly, but after 5 hours, I was at the summit of Four Ladies Mountain, 16,486ft (5025m). It was the highest point I had ever reached.  I was utterly exhausted but a sense of accomplishment, relief, and happiness flooded my mind. "Well, I guess I'll be climbing for the rest of my life." I thought to myself.</p>
